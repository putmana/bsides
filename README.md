### Breathing new life into an old project

![Screenshot of B-Sides](/static/internal/bsides.png)

B-sides originally started out as a project that I built during my freshman year of college. Naturally, it was awful.

Passwords weren't encrypted, redundant modules were everywhere, no comments or sensible variable names. Freshman stuff.

(Also it was before I knew how to use git so forgive the lack of commit history)

Anyway, this is my attempt at bringing that project back from the dead and fixing it up.

Passwords are encrypted now, for example.

Also, I added controller and validator modules to help clean things up and make the app more organized.

Expect more features soon - I want to add replies, profile pictures, subscriptions to other users, and a few other things.

Feel free to check it out [here](https://bsides.ptmn.io) - All I ask is that you be nice! Don't post anything you wouldn't show your grandmother.
